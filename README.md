Ansible Role Nginx
=========

Installs and configures the beloved Nginx webserver.

This playbook highly values the KISS methodology - Keep It Simple Stupid.

- It only takes care of Nginx service installation and configuration -
  deployments would have to go in an extra play/role with a dep on this role.
- It ensures absence of arbitrary vhosts which are explicitly marked as absent.
- It doesn't configure vhosts. This is left to dedicated roles which in turn
  can simply depend on this role.

Example Playbook
----------------

    - hosts: all
      vars:
        nginx_enabled: yes
        nginx_vhost_absent:
          - default
      roles:
         - blunix.role-nginx
