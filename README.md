Ansible Role Nginx
=========

Installs and configures the beloved Nginx webserver.

This playbook highly values the KISS methodology - Keep It Simple Stupid.

- only takes care of Nginx service installation and configuration -
  deployments would have to go in an extra play/role with a dep on this role.
- supports only a single vhost - if you want to configure more vhosts, run this
  role multiple times while passing the corresponding facts.

Example Playbook
----------------

    - hosts: all
      vars:
        nginx_enabled: yes
        nginx_server_name: example.com
      roles:
         - blunix.role-nginx
